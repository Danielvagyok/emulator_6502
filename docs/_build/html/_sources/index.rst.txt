NES Emulator documentation
==========================

This documentation details my implementation of an NES. However, as of now, only
the CPU is in a usable condition.

The goal of this project is to develop a VHDL code which can be synthetised on
an arbitrary FPGA chip to emulate the behavior of an NES.
